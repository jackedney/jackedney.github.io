The Witcher Review:
5 out of 5
When Netflix announced that it was to be adapting the popular fantasy video game the Witcher for its streaming service, I was initially unconvinced. Hollywood adaptations of video games have been notoriously bad over the years, but I can thankfully say that the Witcher surpassed all expectations and hit the nail on the head. The casting was perfect for starters, Henry Cavill was a perfect choice for the titular character Geralt, having not only the perfect build but a great charisma, the brooding expressions and a strong voice to carry off such a powerful character. Thankfully, equally fine acting by Anya Chalotra who played the witch Yennefer and Joey Batey, who played Geralt’s musical sidekick Dandelion, prevented Cavill from having to carry the show. There were epic fight scenes, gorgeous landscapes and literally all the things you’d want for an epic fantasy TV show. Fans of the game will enjoy the format of each episode, each one a kind of individual quest for Geralt, giving each episode its own subplot yet still managing to tie in together to create a great overarching story. I cannot wait for the second season to be released.
