                        The seventh season of the Office improved upon the previous but did not reach the heights of some of the past seasons. The departure of Steve Carell provided fans of the Office one of the best episodes of the entire series Goodbye Michael but leaves us wondering which direction the show will turn in his absence. There were some great episodes in this season but unfortunately some of the jokes felt a bit stale and recycled. The introduction of Deangelo Vickers, played by Will Ferrell, fell flat and his character was just too silly and unbelievable, he only lasted four episodes thank god. Going forward, the Office has its work cut out filling the void left behind by Carell's departure and coming up with new jokes. All in all, this season was a memorable one, but also victim of the show's enormous past successes.
